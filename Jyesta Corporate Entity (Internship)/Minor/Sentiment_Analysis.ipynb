        "## Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q&A\n",
        "The sentiment analysis system was developed by following these steps:\n",
        "1.  **Dataset Loading and Preparation**: A small, mock sentiment analysis dataset consisting of 5 samples was created and loaded into a pandas DataFrame. The text data underwent comprehensive preprocessing, including conversion to lowercase, removal of HTML tags, punctuation, special characters, and numerical digits, stop word removal, and lemmatization. The dataset was then split into training (3 samples) and testing (2 samples) sets with `test_size=0.4` and stratification, resolving an initial `ValueError` caused by the small dataset size.\n",
        "2.  **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) was used to convert the processed text into numerical features. A `TfidfVectorizer` was initialized with `max_features=5000` and applied to the training and test sets, resulting in feature matrices of shapes (3, 16) for training and (2, 16) for testing.\n",
        "3.  **Model Training**: A Logistic Regression model was chosen and trained using the TF-IDF extracted features from the training data. The model was initialized with `solver='liblinear'` and `random_state=42` for robustness.\n",
        "4.  **Model Performance Evaluation**: The trained Logistic Regression model was evaluated on the held-out test set. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, were calculated. A classification report was generated, handling a potential `UndefinedMetricWarning` by setting `zero_division=1`. A confusion matrix was also generated to visually represent the model's classification performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   **Dataset Preprocessing**: The text data was thoroughly preprocessed, including lowercasing, removal of HTML tags, punctuation, special characters, and digits, stop word removal, and lemmatization.\n",
        "*   **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF successfully transformed the textual data into numerical features, with the vectorizer identifying 16 unique terms from the mock dataset (limited by `max_features`).\n",
        "*   **Model Training**: A Logistic Regression model was successfully trained on the TF-IDF features.\n",
        "*   **Model Performance (on mock data)**:\n",
        "    *   The model achieved an **accuracy of 0.50**.\n",
        "    *   For the 'negative' class (0): Precision was 0.50, Recall was 1.00, and F1-score was 0.67.\n",
        "    *   For the 'positive' class (1): Precision was 1.00 (due to `zero_division=1`), Recall was 0.00, and F1-score was 0.00.\n",
        "    *   The confusion matrix visually confirmed 1 True Positive (for class 0), 1 False Negative (for class 1), 0 False Positives, and 0 True Negatives.\n",
        "*   **Small Dataset Impact**: The very small mock dataset (3 training, 2 testing samples) significantly impacted the reliability and interpretability of the evaluation metrics, as evidenced by the `UndefinedMetricWarning` and unstable metric values.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   To obtain more reliable and generalizable performance metrics, the system should be re-evaluated using a significantly larger and more representative dataset (e.g., the full IMDB dataset) to overcome the limitations observed with the current small mock dataset.\n",
        "*   Explore more advanced models (e.g., neural networks like LSTMs or Transformers) or fine-tune the Logistic Regression model's hyperparameters to potentially improve performance on a larger dataset.\n"
