        "\n",
        "*   **Game Logic Implementation:** The core Tic-Tac-Toe game logic was successfully implemented within the `TicTacToe` class, including:\n",
        "    *   Initializing a 3x3 game board.\n",
        "    *   A `display_board` method for clear console output.\n",
        "    *   A `make_move` method that validates moves (within bounds, empty cell) and updates the board.\n",
        "    *   A `check_win` method that accurately identifies win conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals for a given player.\n",
        "    *   A `check_draw` method that determines if the board is full without a winner.\n",
        "*   **Evaluation Function Development:** An `evaluate_board` method was added to the `TicTacToe` class, which correctly assigns scores based on terminal game states:\n",
        "    *   Returns 10 if the AI player wins.\n",
        "    *   Returns -10 if the human player wins.\n",
        "    *   Returns 0 for a draw or an ongoing game.\n",
        "*   **Minimax Algorithm Implementation:** The `minimax` algorithm was successfully implemented as a recursive function, `minimax(depth, is_maximizing_player, ai_player, human_player)`:\n",
        "    *   It handles base cases for win, loss, and draw conditions, adjusting scores by depth to prioritize faster wins and delay losses.\n",
        "    *   It explores all possible future game states by temporarily making and undoing moves.\n",
        "    *   It correctly identifies the best move for the AI (maximizing player) and the worst move for the human (minimizing player).\n",
        "*   **Optimal Move Selection:** A `find_best_move` method was implemented to utilize the `minimax` algorithm, enabling the AI to determine its optimal move by evaluating all available positions and choosing the one that yields the highest score according to the Minimax evaluation.\n",
        "*   **AI Integration and Game Loop:** The `play_game` method was developed to integrate the AI into the game flow:\n",
        "    *   It manages player turns, displays the board, and continuously checks for win/draw conditions.\n",
        "    *   It prompts the human player for input with robust validation for valid moves.\n",
        "    *   It calls the AI's `find_best_move` and executes the AI's chosen move, incorporating a small `time.sleep` delay for a better user experience.\n",
        "*   **Functional Game:** The full implementation resulted in a functional Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human can play against the Minimax AI. The AI consistently makes optimal moves, demonstrating its capability to prevent human wins or secure a win for itself if possible, ultimately leading to either an AI win or a draw against a competent human player.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Unbeatable AI:** The implemented Minimax AI for Tic-Tac-Toe is effectively unbeatable as it explores all possible game states to make optimal moves, ensuring it will always win or draw if played correctly.\n",
        "*   **Extend to Larger Games:** While effective for Tic-Tac-Toe, consider how to optimize or modify the Minimax algorithm (e.g., Alpha-Beta Pruning) for games with larger state spaces to maintain computational efficiency.\n"
